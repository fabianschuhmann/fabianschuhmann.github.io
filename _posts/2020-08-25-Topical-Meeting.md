**Abstract: **

We have developed an approach that utilizes a Monte-Carlo algorithm to construct 3D structures of polypeptide chains which could then be studied as stand-alone macro-molecule, or compliment the structure of known proteins. Using an algorithm to avoid steric clashes, the proposed approach allows to create multiple structures for the same pre-defined primary sequence of amino acids. These structures could then effectively be used for further analysis and investigation. In this presentation we will illustrate the algorithm and describes its userfriendly approach that was made possible through the VIKING online platform. Finally we provide several highlight examples where the modeler was used to predict the structure of the C-terminal of a known protein, generate a missing bit of already crystallized protein structures and simply generate short polypeptide chains.
