<b>Abstract</b><br>
In a short presentation, we showed the basic functionality and possibilities of the online-platform VIKING (Scandinavian Online Kit for Nanoscale Modeling) to simplify running computational tasks for beginners and to enhance the efficiency of experienced users. In the course of the presentation the basic layout of VIKING was shown. A quick introduction was given to our latest feature, the automated ligand searcher (ALISE), which allows to test ligands with a receptor for drug discovery. Lastly the implementation of Pep McConst, our user-friendly peptide modeler, was discussed with a quick introduction to the algorithm.
