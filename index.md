In October 2023, I joined the group of [Weria Pezeshkian](https://nbi.ku.dk/ansatte/?pure=da/persons/733547) as a post-doc at the [Niels Bohr Institute](https://nbi.ku.dk/english/) at the [University of Copenhagen](https://www.ku.dk/english/).

In February 2023, I successfully defended my Ph.D. thesis entitled "Spotting the difference â€“ tailored tools to analyze protein dynamics" at [quantbiolab](https://quantbiolab.com/) supervised by [Prof. Ilia Solov'yov](https://quantbiolab.com/group/ilia-solovyov) at the [Carl von Ossietzky University Oldenburg](https://uol.de/en). The group develops and maintains the online platform 'Scandinavian Online Kit for Nanoscale Modeling' [VIKING](https://viking-suite.com/) which provides a user-friendly approach to molecular dynamics simulations among other things.

I joined quantbiolab after finishing my Masters at the [Ruhr University Bochum](https://www.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/en).

## Current Interests and Projects:

- Data Analysis
- Molecular Dynamics Simulations (all-atom and coarse-grained)
- Methodology development for Protein analyses
- Non-Euclidean Distances
