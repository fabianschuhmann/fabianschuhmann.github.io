In February 2023, I successfully defended my Ph.D. thesis entitled "Spotting the difference â€“ tailored tools to analyze protein dynamics" at [quantbiolab](https://quantbiolab.com/) supervised by [Prof. Ilia Solov'yov](https://quantbiolab.com/group/ilia-solovyov) at the [Carl von Ossietzky University Oldenburg](https://uol.de/en). The group develops and maintains the online platform 'Scandinavian Online Kit for Nanoscale Modeling' [VIKING](https://viking-suite.com/) which provides a user-friendly approach to molecular dynamics simulations among other things.

I joined quantbiolab after finishing my Masters at the [Ruhr University Bochum](https://www.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/en).

I am a member of the interdisciplinary Research Training School [RTG1885](https://uol.de/en/sensorybio) on the molecular basis of sensory biology. The RTG cooperates with the [SFB1372](https://www.sfb1372.de/) on magnetoreception and navigation in vertebrates.

## Current Interests and Projects:

- Data Analysis
- Molecular Dynamics Simulations (all-atom and coarse-grained)
- Methodology development for Protein analyses
- Non-Euclidean Distances
