<b>Abstract</b><br>
A prolongation of the study describing all-atom pigeon cryptochrome 4's conformational changes in the framework of a classical molecular simulation were presented. In the prolongation a coarse-graining approach, utilizing Martini, was implemented to simulate cryptochrome over significantly longer time. The longer time scale was used to computationally reoxidize the flavin cofactor and probe, if the conformational changes previously observed would revert.
