<b>Abstract</b><br>
I presented a sequence of case studies spanning all-atom to supra coarse-grained modelling. These included all-atom simulations of pigeon cryptochrome 4 following charge transfer and radical-pair formation relevant for magnetosensing, integrative modelling of cross-linking data to constrain protein conformational ensembles, and recent developments in TS2CG 2.0 for constructing large-scale, geometry-aware membrane systems. I concluded with ongoing work on the amyloid precursor protein in an Alzheimer’s disease context, illustrating how molecular simulations can be embedded in experimentally connected workflows across length scales.
