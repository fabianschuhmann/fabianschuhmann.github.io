[SiMBols](https://gitlab.uni-oldenburg.de/quantbiolab/simbols)
SiMBols is a python package designed to make similarity measures easily accessible for biological systems and to compare spatio-temporal data. The package offers a unified approach to calculate the Frechet distance, the weak Frechet distance, the Hausdorff distance, dynamic time warping, Wasserstein distance, Kullback-Leibler divergence, longest common subsequence and an approach based on difference distance matrices.
