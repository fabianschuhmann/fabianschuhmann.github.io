TS2CG 2.0 is a tool to create initial membrane systems in arbitrary shapes. The program also  allows the easy lateral organization of both lipids and proteins. TS2CG is implemented in C++ and includes two separate scripts. Pointillism and CG Membrane Builder. A custom python framework allows the manipulation of membrane to fine-tune lateral organization of lipids and proteins. The repository is available [here](https://github.com/weria-pezeshkian/TS2CG) with the documentation for the C++ programs. The documentation for the python framework can be found [here](https://weria-pezeshkian.github.io/TS2CG_python_documentation/)


[SiMBols](https://gitlab.uni-oldenburg.de/quantbiolab/simbols)
SiMBols is a python package designed to make similarity measures easily accessible for biological systems and to compare spatio-temporal data. The package offers a unified approach to calculate the Frechet distance, the weak Frechet distance, the Hausdorff distance, dynamic time warping, Wasserstein distance, Kullback-Leibler diivergence, longest common subsequence and an approach based on difference distance matrices.
